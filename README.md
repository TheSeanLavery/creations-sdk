# creations-sdk
Soon


Dropping some goodies for now while we wait
- plugin-demo shows the various features available to r1 creations
- qr is a simple site you can self-host to create scannable codes.

## Development policy

- Do not start any local web servers from this repository. Build assets and open static HTML files directly when needed.
- If a server is required temporarily for testing, document the exact command and ports in the specific app's README, and shut it down immediately after use.
